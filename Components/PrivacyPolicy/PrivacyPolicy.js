                  <p>Thanks for using Atlassian’s Cloud Products! These Atlassian Cloud Terms of Service (these “Terms”) describe your rights and responsibilities as a customer of our Cloud Products. As applicable to the specific Cloud Product, if you are being invited or added to a Cloud Product set up by an Atlassian customer, the User Notice governs your access and use of the Cloud Product (and not these Terms). These Terms are between you and the Atlassian entity that owns or operates the Cloud Product that you are using or accessing listed here (“Atlassian”, “we” or “us”). “You” means the entity you represent in accepting these Terms or, if that does not apply, you individually. If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms; (ii) you have read and understand these Terms; and (iii) you agree to these Terms on behalf of the party that you represent. If you don’t have the legal authority to bind your employer or the applicable entity please do not click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) that is presented to you.  PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A CLOUD PRODUCT USING AN EMAIL ADDRESS FROM YOUR EMPLOYER OR ANOTHER ENTITY, THEN (A) YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT SUCH PARTY, (B) YOUR CLICK TO ACCEPT WILL BIND YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY TO THESE TERMS, AND (C) THE WORD “YOU” IN THESE TERMS WILL REFER TO YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY.

                  These Terms are effective as of the date you first click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) or use or access a Cloud Product, whichever is earlier (the “Effective Date”). These Terms do not have to be signed in order to be binding. You indicate your assent to these Terms by clicking “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) at the time you register for a Cloud Product, create a Cloud Product account, or place an Order. For No-Charge Products, you also indicate your assent to these Terms by accessing or using the applicable No-Charge Product.</p>
